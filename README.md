# My Resume

On this website I introduce myself to potential employers. The website was created based on a Code Institute student project, which I completed for fun and interest. Interested parties from all over the world can find out more about my strengths and interests on this website. You also have access to a downloadable print version of my CV and you can view my projects on Github. Finally, you can write to me directly via this website to ask further questions or to arrange an appointment. I will then reply as soon as possible.

### The Homepage

- __The Slide Show and Slogan section__

#### The Slogan part

  - The Slogan part is located on the left part of the section. It will allow the user to see the benefits of starting with sports and all excuses will be refuted. 
  - This user will see the value of Coachfinder and coaches will see a chance to get clients. 

#### The Slide Show

  - The slide show is in the right part of the section. The images change from right to left. After the last picture, the slide show starts from the beginning. The images change automatically, but can also be changed manually.
  - A few lines of javascript were used for the automatic image shift. The basic code of the slide show is taken from the following website, but has been modified.
    - [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wvrlOyGlq0)
  - The slide show will convey positive impressions about Coachfinder and motivate the user to use Coachfinder.

- Slogan and Slideshow
<img src="assets/images/screenshot-slogan-slideshow.png" alt="Slogan-Slideshow">

  #### The Map section

    - In this section the user can see exactly where a coach is available for the desired sport. So the map offers an alternative way to start training or to learn something new. The goal is achieved by clicking on a trainer instead of selecting a sport via the sports page.
    - The View larger map - Link on the left leads to the real **_google maps_** map and the personal Websites of potential coaches.
    - Since the website doesn't actually exist and no coaches are registered, only an example destination in Ireland appears. In the future, however, numerous trainers should be able to be found when scrolling and zooming through the **_google maps_** map. These can then be clicked on, which will take you to their Coachfinder profile. In this profile, the trainers will be able to advertise themselves.
    - This section will be updated as new choaches sign in. 

    - Map
    <img src="assets/images/screenshot-map2.png" alt="Map">


### The Sport-Page

- __Choose a sport section__

  - The gallersectiony will provide the user with sport categories to choose. 
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily find the type of sport they want to train.
  - This section contains a dropdown menu that appears when the user mouses over an item. The elements following below are shifted down. The basic code has a similar structure to the drop-down menu in the header, but has been adapted to current needs.
  - The sports categories lead to specific sports via the drop-down menu. These are links and may be clicked in the future. Numerous coaches and sports clubs will then be displayed on the following web pages. Here the users must then also announce their location in order to narrow down the selection. Since there are many more sports and no real coaches are registered and numerous follow-up web pages would be necessary, the links lead to a specific sport example page. Because there are far too many sports and only three pages to create, there is only one sample page in this practice website. The other specific sport pages will be created in the future. 


  - Sport-Dropdown

  - Sport-Dropdown-extended 
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-sport-selector2.png" alt="Sport-Dropdown">


- __The Map section__

  - Since this section is an alternative to the drop down menu above to find a trainer, the map here is the same as on the home page.


### The Contact-Page

__The Send us a message section__

  - This section will allow the user to send us (***coachfinder-company***) a message with feddback, questions, suggestions, and complaints.
  - to submit the message, the has to type in an e-mail address. 
  - If it were a real website, the only way the company could reply was like that. If the user wants to delete his message or e-mail address, the Clear Form button can be clicked.
  - After sending the message, the user will receive confirmation that the message has arrived and is being processed. Since Coachfinder does not have a real server, the ***Code-Institute*** server was used as an example. Since no nice answer appears here, a *Receive Answer button* has been added. Clicking on this button demonstrates how feedback will look like in the future. If the company ever exists, this button will be deleted.
  - The *Receive Answer button* leads to a **fourth web page (The Response Page)** that can only be reached here. 

  - Contact
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-contact.png" alt="Contact">


### The Response Page

  - The Response Page contains the same header and footer as the other web pages. Additionally, there is a response section under the header. Here is the message that the request has been received and is being processed.

  - Response
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-response.png" alt="Response">


### The Login Page

  - This page will allow the user to log in to coachfinder. If the user has not yet registered, he can do so here. No user can log in without having registered. After klicking the sign up button oder the login butten, without beeing registered, the user comes to the signup page.

  - Login
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-login.png" alt="Login">


### The Sign Up Pages

  - There are two Sign Up pages with different headings. To the first one the user comes by clicking the Sign Up button, to the other page the user comes by trying to log in without being registered first. Other than that, both sides are the same. The user can register here. All fields are mandatory.
  - A few lines of javascript were used for the repeat-password field. The basic code for this is taken from the following website.
    - [Codepen](https://codepen.io/diegoleme/pen/qBpyvr)

  - Sign Up
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-signup.png" alt="Sign Up">

  - Sign Up-Mistake
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-signup-mistake.png" alt="Sign Up">


### The Thank You Page

  - The Thank You (thx) page contains a landing image with a message inside. In it, the company Coachfinder thanks the user for registering it. In the future, the user will now receive an email in which he must click a confirmation link. This will lead him to a Coachfinder profile page. In the future he can then set up his profile. This page will be created in the future.

  - Thank You
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-thank-you.png" alt="Thank You">


### The Sport Category Page

  - The Sport Category page contains a landing image and a dropdown menu below. It is the same dropdown menu like the spors page. But only the sport category that the user clicked appears. Because there are far too many sports categories and only three pages to create, there is only one sample sports category page in this practice website. The other sports category pages will be created in the future.
  - The dropdown menu contains links to a specific sport page. Because there are far too many sports and only three pages to create, there is only one sample page in this practice website. The other specific sport pages will be created in the future.

  - Sport Category
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-sport-category.png" alt="Sport Category">


### The Specific Sport Page 

  - The Specific Sport Page contains a list of coaches to choose. 
  - Here the user finds all the information he needs to decide on a trainer. This coach can then be contacted directly.
  - In the future you will find here a selection selected by location. The location is taken from the profile but can be changed here temporarily (travel situation). There will also be the option of contacting the coach via a chat function.

  - Specific Sport
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-specific-sport.png" alt="Specific Sport">

### Features Left to Implement

  - Planned features: 
    - A Profile page. Here you will be able to set up your profile. This is particularly important for coaches and sports club owners who want to market themselves. 
    - All sport category and all specific sports pages that can be selected from the main sports page. Here, as a user, you will select a coach who is nearby and use the link to further information about her/him.
    - A chat function will be added to the specific sport page to contact the coach directly.
    - A location selector will be added to the specific sport page.
    - The map will show many destinations leading to the coaches' profiles.

### Unfixed Bugs

 - No Bugs are unfixed.
 - There were a few bugs, but they were fixed within a short time. 
  - For example, the Sports category page displayed well in Firefox and not in Google Chrome. The image formatting caused free white areas to appear on the page in Google Chrome. 
  - Another difficulty was the dropdown button (Sport) in the header menu. This had to be formatted separately, just like the other menu buttons.



## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - In menu on the left side, select pages
  - Scrool down to Branch and select main
  - push the Save button
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

### Personal Advice

  - Thank You!
    -  Jubril Akolade
    - All people from my Slack Group!![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome danio86,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

------

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

---

Happy coding!
